        <p>First-time visitors to The Villages will soon notice that there’s something different about this central
            Florida community. Friendly, laid-back, sun-drenched, fun-loving—so far, typical Florida. But The Villages’
            special appeal lies with its unique status as one of the state’s best-known retirement communities. Created
            through the vision of one man, The Villages has grown from a private real estate development into a thriving
            neighborhood of homes, stores, restaurants, social spaces, and recreational facilities. The Villages
            vacation rentals offer visitors the rare chance to experience the silver lining of life’s golden years in
            true Florida style.</p>
